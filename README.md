# 2D Platformer Demo

A simple 2D Platformer game made in Godot, to learn the basics of the engine and GDScript.


## Assets

For this project i used the [Pixel Adventure Asset](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pixel-adventure-1) - made by Pixel Frog.

## What i learned?

- Nodes
    - It's very similar to the Unity components.
- Sprites
    - Importing and creating animations.
- GDScript
    - Basic character movements, animation handlers and collectables. 
    - I also implemented the singleton pattern for game manager node and UI, in Godot it's called Autoload.
- Tilemaps
    - Import and collision configuration. I used one-way collision for the platforms (see the 2nd gif), it's simpler than I thought, very practical.
- Scenes
    - It's a equivalent of Unity prefabs.
- Camera
    - Setting the camera to follow the player and configure the limits to not get off the scene.
## About my experience using the engine

It's more easy and fun that i thought. I was very hesitant to quit Unity, but after undertanding the basics of the engine and GDScript, i change my mind, it's a powerful and fast engine. (not having to wait about 20 seconds to compile the project is relieving)
